# Description 
It's a dictionary react app for anyone that wants to search for the definition of a word. Users can see a list of all of the valid or invalid words that they searched and then click on a valid word to see all the details about that word on a separate page. In the future, I'd like to add a feature so that users can see the meaning of the word that they searched in any different language that they want.
